  historyPara: "JCTC robotics was unofficially founded in 2015, consisting of students from 2 schools, East and West jessamine highschools, we began with almost nothing. \
                a getto field peiced together from pvc pipes, one team with a bot that wouldn't stay together, and \
                two coaches that were begrugingly accomodating some students' weird hobby. \
                Then everything changed in 2016. 1859X was 3rd picked at state on the winning alliance. So we got to go to worlds \
                this fired everyone up beyond any and all expectations and the program picked up a lot of steam. Suddenly many other students were interested in joining, and many of the existing members \
                became more dedicated to winning. With this dedication we went on to win 1st and 2nd place, as well as skills, at state in 2017-2018's game: In The Zone. \
                three of our teams qualified for worlds that year and even won awards. We hope that our program contenues to grow at this rate for the future.",
