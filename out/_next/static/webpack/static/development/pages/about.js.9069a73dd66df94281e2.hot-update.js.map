So we got to go to worlds \\\r\n                this fired everyone up beyond any and all expectations and the program picked up a lot of steam. Suddenly many other students were interested in joining, and many of the existing members \\\r\n                became more dedicated to winning. With this dedication we went on to win 1st and 2nd place, as well as skills, at state in 2017-2018's game: In The Zone. \\\r\n                three of our teams qualified for worlds that year and even won awards. We hope that our program contenues to grow at this rate for the future.\",\r\n  joinPara: \"To join simply contact greg caminisch, please note that you will have to be currrently enrolled in the jessamine county school system.
