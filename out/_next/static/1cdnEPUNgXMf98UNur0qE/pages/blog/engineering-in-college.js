This is hard for many people, because STEM naturally attracts the most knowledgeable. Suddenly being dropped in a situation where everyone is just as smart or smarter than you, who have up to this point often been the smartest person in the room, is a difficult thing to get used to. Add to this that the first classes you take are often the hardest and it can be a serious blow to your motivation and self-worth. The best words I can offer are to not take it personally, most people have or are going to go through this at some point, get through it and try to move on.
