Then everything changed in 2016. 1859X was 3rd picked at state on the winning alliance. So we got to go to worlds                 this fired everyone up beyond any and all expectations and the program picked up a lot of steam. Suddenly many other students were interested in joining, and many of the existing members                 became more dedicated to winning. With this dedication we went on to win 1st and 2nd place, as well as skills, at state in 2017-2018&#x27;s game: In The Zone.                 three of our teams qualified for worlds that year and even won awards. We hope that our program contenues to grow at this rate for the future.</p></div></section><section class="coaches" id="coaches"><div><h1>Coaches</h1><p>The current leaders of the 1859 Robotics organization</p><div class="cards"><div class="card" style="transform:translateX(-30px)"><h3>Greg</h3><p>I am Greg Caminisch, I am one of the first movers for the 1859 Robotics organization and along with Andrea O&#x27;bryan formed the first 1859 team.
