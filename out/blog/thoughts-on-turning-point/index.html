I do not think this game is as good as starstruck was however I do think turning point is better than in the zone.</p><p>First and foremost this game eliminates &quot;skills bots,&quot; bots that have the pure intent of getting a high skills score and completely throw competition by the wayside. This is a much needed improvement from last year, because of the relative ease of creation of skills bots they were very prevalent this inherently is not a problem, if a team wants to focus on skills that&#x27;s fine. However due to the collaborative nature of VRC the teams that focused on skills can and would hurt teams they were paired with in game.</p><p>This game is also very multifaceted, you have to juggle stacking caps, shooting balls, and controlling platforms. This is a deparcher from past VRC games which have typically focused on one or maybe two tasks. I believe that this encourages specialization of bots thus lowering the barrier of entry while also challenging higher level teams to design around more things.</p><p>Turning point is a very unorthodox game and I feel that it will provide some very interesting world&#x27;s bots, but for now it is a lot of super sketchy bots that don&#x27;t really do much, but isn&#x27;t that how it is every year?</p></div><footer>Â© <!-- -->2018<!-- --> <!-- -->JCTC Robotics</footer></div></div><script>__NEXT_DATA__ = {"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/blog/thoughts-on-turning-point","query":{},"buildId":"gugxcQiJ_NYzfZc3F~1_F","nextExport":true};__NEXT_LOADED_PAGES__=[];__NEXT_REGISTER_PAGE=function(r,f){__NEXT_LOADED_PAGES__.push([r, f])}</script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/blog/thoughts-on-turning-point" src="/_next/static/gugxcQiJ_NYzfZc3F~1_F/pages/blog/thoughts-on-turning-point.js"></script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/_app" src="/_next/static/gugxcQiJ_NYzfZc3F~1_F/pages/_app.js"></script><script async="" id="__NEXT_PAGE__/_error" src="/_next/static/gugxcQiJ_NYzfZc3F~1_F/pages/_error.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/webpack-89179faa512dd01fbb62.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.da9b2cb08b71b450955b.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/styles.07de860a3ddaa3e989a1.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/runtime/main-74d154bf1f75f652709f.js" async=""></script></body></html>
