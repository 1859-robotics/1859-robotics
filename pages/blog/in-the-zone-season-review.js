      <h2>1859 as an organization</h2>
<p>Overall this was the first year that we all got serious, we got 3 of our teams to worlds, won state skills and competition, won more awards then the combined history of the program. We feel that this has been an extremely successful season overall and hope to continue this success.</p>
<h2>1859X</h2>
<p>This was both an extremely disappointing and extremely exciting year for us. The combination of several factors prevented us from being totally successful however we were more successful than we have ever been. Team dynamics, time issues, inexperience and more prevented us from being able to preform at optimal capacity. This being said we still won a multitude of awards and were the primary leader of the organization. Our new programmer put a new focus on programming thus our autonomous programs were very good compared to what they have been. The programmer bled over into almost all teams, providing sample code and advice to other teams. and was the primary reason 1859S got to worlds. This being said, our time management was very poor we spent almost all of our time on programming and left little time for our driver. This resulted in many situations where we would preform very poorly in qualifier rounds then move on to do very well in the elimination bracket, once our driver warmed up. This was perhaps most evident at state where we placed our 16th in qualification rounds then went on to get 2nd in the elimination rounds. We cannot let this happen again thus we will strive for better balance between programming, driving, and programming.</p>
